My name is Allen Lin and I'm a 4th-year CS student at Northeastern University. I was born in Taiwan and I moved to the United States when I was 13. I'm deeply passionate about AGI, tech entrepreneurship, and education. My goal is to accelerate innovation and help solve the most significant challenges of the 21st century - namely, understanding how the human brain works.

I'm currently building an edtech startup called [Fireplace](https://makefireplace.com) and running a startup community in Boston called [rev](https://rev.school). I love learning and sharing knowledge, so I hope you can find something useful in my blog.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat!
